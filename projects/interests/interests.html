        <p>Cricket is a sport that I deeply enjoy because of its strategy, skill, and teamwork. It is played between two teams, with the goal of scoring more runs than the opponent. The game consists of batting, bowling, and fielding, making it a dynamic and engaging sport.</p>
        <p>What I love most about cricket is the thrill of competition and the excitement of every ball bowled. Whether it’s the fast-paced action of T20 matches or the long strategic battles in Test cricket, every format has something unique to offer. Watching and playing cricket gives me a sense of joy and a deep appreciation for the sport’s history and great players.</p>
