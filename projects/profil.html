    <h1>  Hello My Name is Karthik Dasari </h1>
    <p> <strong>My name is Karthiki Dasari,</strong> and I am from India. I was born and brought up in a small city called Hyderabad, where I grew up in a middle-class family. Life wasn't always easy, and I faced many trials and challenges along the way. However, I overcame them with the help of Jesus Christ, always seeking His guidance and strength.My hobbies are playing video games, trying different kinds of foods, and traveling.</p>
    <p>I completed my school in 2021 and then went <mark>on a mission to New Delhi, India.</mark> During my mission, I learned many valuable lessons about life, independence, and service. Serving in the mission changed my life in profound ways, and I am grateful for the experience. After completing my mission, I began my application process for BYU-Hawaii. It wasn't easy, as I struggled with my English tests, but after a lot of practice, I finally passed and made it here to study</p>
